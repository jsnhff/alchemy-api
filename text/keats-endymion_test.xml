    <preface>
        Knowing within myself the manner in
        which this Poem has been produced, it
        is not without a feeling of regret that I
        make it public.

        What manner I mean, will be quite
        clear to the reader, who must soon perceive
        great inexperience, immaturity,
        and every error denoting a feverish attempt,
        rather than a deed accomplished.
        The two first books, and indeed the two
        last, I feel sensible are not of such completion
        as to warrant their passing the
        press; nor should they if I thought a

        year's castigation would do them any
        good;-it will not: the foundations are
        too sandy. It is just that this youngster
        should die away: a sad thought for me,
        if I had not some hope that while it is
        dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting
        myself for verses fit to live.

        This may be speaking too presumptuously,
        and may deserve a punishment:
        but no feeling man will be forward to
        inflict it: he will leave me alone, with
        the conviction that there is not a fiercer
        hell than the failure in a great object.
        This is not written with the least atom of
        purpose to forestall criticisms of course,
        but from the desire I have to conciliate
        men who are competent to look, and who
        do look with a zealous eye, to the honour
        of English literature.

        The imagination of a boy is healthy,
        and the mature imagination of a man is
        healthy; but there is a space of life between,
        in which the soul is in a ferment,
        the character undecided, the way of life
        uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted:
        thence proceeds mawkishness, and all
        the thousand bitters which those men
        I speak of must necessarily taste in going
        over the following pages.

        I hope I have not in too late a
        day touched the beautiful mythology of
        Greece, and dulled its brightness: for I
        wish to try once more, before I bid it
        farewel.
